## Authentication & Email OTP Setup

This project includes a complete authentication flow:
1. **Sign Up**: New users create an account with username, email, and password.
2. **Login**: Users login with email and password; a 6-digit OTP is sent to their email.
3. **Verify**: Users enter the OTP to complete login and access the app.

### Running the application locally

You need to run both the frontend and the email relay backend.

**Step 1: Setup SMTP credentials**
Copy `server/.env.example` to `server/.env` and add your SMTP credentials:

```bash
# Using SendGrid SMTP:
SERVER_PORT=4000
SMTP_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=apikey
SMTP_PASS=YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

Or use Gmail (requires app password):
```bash
SERVER_PORT=4000
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=your.email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your_app_password
FROM_EMAIL=your.email@gmail.com
```

**Step 2: Install and run the email relay server**
```powershell
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
# Server runs on http://localhost:4000
```

**Step 3: In another terminal, run the frontend**
```powershell
cd ..
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5173 (or the URL Vite shows)
```

### Testing the flow

1. **First visit**: You'll be redirected to `/signup`.
2. **Sign up**: Enter username, email, password → you'll be sent to `/login`.
3. **Login**: Email and password are prefilled. Click "Send verification code" → OTP is emailed to your inbox.
4. **Verify**: Enter the 6-digit OTP from your email → you'll land on the homepage.
5. **Return visits**: If users already exist, you'll go to `/login` directly (skip signup).

### Security notes

- **Client-side demo**: User credentials are stored in `localStorage` (plaintext). For production, use a backend database with bcrypt password hashing.
- **Email relay**: The `server/index.js` relays OTPs via SMTP. Never expose SMTP credentials to the client — keep them in `server/.env` only.
- **Optional env var**: To change the server URL from the default `http://localhost:4000`, add `VITE_EMAIL_SERVER_URL=...` to `.env.local` and restart the frontend.
