---

## 8. Defects Summary

| Bug ID | Title | Severity | Status |
|--------|--------|-----------|---------|
| BUG-001 | Map not loading | High | Open |
| BUG-002 | Journal encryption fail | Critical | In Progress |
| BUG-003 | CBT progress missing | Medium | Open |
| BUG-004 | Dark mode broken | Low | Open |
| BUG-005 | Offline filter lag | Low | Open |

---

## 9. Recommendations
- Implement offline caching for CBT progress  
- Add fallback static map when network is weak  
- Review dark-mode styling  
- Optimize resource filtering  

---

## 10. Conclusion
The MVP is stable enough for demonstration.  
Primary functionality works as expected, and all critical security features are operational.  
Remaining issues do not block core use cases and can be fixed post-hackathon.

**Status:** ✔ Ready for Demo
